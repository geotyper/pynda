* Bullet-proof loading state
    * Are all vectors duplicating?
    * Instead of new world, clear all vectors then load?
* Parallelize
    * Step function with given spheres input
    * Recursive tree to generate sphere update domains
    * Thread dispatching
        * Thread objects pause, have accessible memory for sphere list updates
    * Memory sorting in both spheres and neighbors in grid
